# run_all.bash #

Simple bash script that will run each test (by calling the run_test program),
add the results and print the final grade. It will also call init and cleanup
functions for the testing environment, before and after running the test suite.

# run_test #

The main program that implements the test suite. It runs a specific test
depending on the test id/number received as a parameter. If the received
first parameter is init or cleanup, it will run the init, respectively cleanup
functions mentioned above.

It can be implemented in any language (e.g. bash, C or python),
depending on the tested homework.

The program can be split up in 4 main sections:
1. General declarations and util functions
- Defines global variables, macros, debug function, etc.
- For example, we recommend using basic_test method, that will
implement the common functionality of the test suite
and that can be called from most of the tests.

2. Init and cleanup
- Defines init and cleanup methods not only for the whole
testing environment but also for each individual test.

3. Test suite
- Defines each individual test function and adds it in a global array and
next to it the points given for that test. As a recommendation, each test
should clearly specify its scope in the methods name - e.g. the tested
functionality, stress test, etc.

4. Main
- Runs the test specified as a parameter.

# Data files #

There will be 3 directories that can be used for storing
the input, output or reference files.
