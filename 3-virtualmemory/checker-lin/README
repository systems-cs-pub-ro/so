== BUILDING ==

The local folder must contain the vmsim library file (libvmsim.so).

Use the Makefile to properly build the vmsim_test executable:

	make -f Makefile.checker

This command will also run all tests and print out the results.

== RUNNING ==

In order to run the test suite you can either use the run_all.sh
script or run the vmsim_test executable.

The run_all.sh script runs all tests and computes assigment grade (90
points maximum):

	./run_all.sh

In order to run a specific test pass the test number (1 .. 33) to the
vmsim_test executable. The loader must be able to locate the library file
(libvmsim.so) (use LD_LIBRARY_PATH):

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./vmsim_test 12

Most tests do not invoke the vmsim_cleanup call. Make sure you remove any
temporary files created (RAM and swap files).

== TESTS ==

Tests are basically unit tests. A single function in the test_fun_array (see
vmsim_test.c) is called each time the vimsim_test executable is invoked,
testing a single functionality (and assuming previous tests have been run and
passed).

The EXIT_IF_FAIL macro (see run_test.c) is unnecessary since after each test, the
program completes.

Each test function follows the unit test pattern: initialization, action,
evaluation.  The test macro (see run_test.h) is invoked at the end of each test
for evaluating and grading the test.

== DEBUGGING ==

The debug.h header file consists of several macros useful for debugging
(dprintf, dlog). There are multiple uses of these macros throughout the above
files.

In order to turn debug messages on, you must define the DEBUG macro, either in
a header file, or, I suggest, in the Makefile. The LOG_LEVEL macro limits the
log message types that are to be printed, by default LOG_WARNING (see enum in
debug.h). You may redefine it in a header file or in the Makefile.

Rapid enabling of debug messages is achieved by commenting out the CPPFLAGS
line in the Makefile. It turns on debugging and enabled all log messages
(LOG_DEBUG).

== OTHER ==

srand48() and drand48() are used for generating random numbers.
